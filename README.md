# Codelab units / projects from Android Developers
## >> Android Basics in Kotlin <<

These units are taken from [Android Developers, Android Basics in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course).

The files in my Repo were made by me, following the Step-By-Step introductions. You can find all solutions on the [GitHub Account
from Google Developer Training](https://github.com/google-developer-training/). Those files are licensed under the Apache 2 license
(Apache-2.0 license ) and multimedia files like audio and image files are under the CC BY 4.0 license.

In the first units I followed strictly their introductions, inclusevly I taken their comments. In the newer units I began to write
my own comments. In the future, after the basic course, I want to play more with the projects by changing images and functions to
improve my skills.

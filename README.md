##  Codelab units / projects from Android Developers

These units are taken from [Android Developers, Android Basics in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course).

The files in my Repo were made by me, following the Step-By-Step introductions. But the multimedia files are provided by Google.
You can find all solutions on the [GitHub Account of Google Developer Training](https://github.com/google-developer-training/).
Those files are licensed under the Apache 2 license (Apache-2.0 license ) and multimedia files like audio and images are under
the CC BY 4.0 license.

In the first units I followed strictly their introductions (except the codelabs which I needed to complete independently),
inclusevly I taken their comments. In the newer units I began to write my own comments. In the future, after the basic course,
I want to play more with the projects by changing functions, multimedia etc. to improve my skills.

**Codelabs which I completed independently:**
* Lemonade App
* Dogglers App

These type of units give you introductions instead of step-by-step solutions. The foundation and tests are predefined, but the implementation
of some function need to be implementated by the student independently. After implementing the functions you can test these against the predefined 
tests, made by the Developers Team. The predefined code is under Copyright by Android Developers!

**Important Information:**
This repo is just for presenting my progress with the units and my solution!
